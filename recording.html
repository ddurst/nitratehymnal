<p><i>The Nitrate Hymnal</i> is a record of songs taken from the hit post-punk opera of the same name, a joint collaboration by <a href="http://www.antisocialmusic.org" target="new">Anti-Social Music</a> and the <a href="http://www.genarowlandsband.com" target="new">Gena Rowlands Band</a>.  The recording presents reorchestrations of songs taken from the original opera production, and hits stores in April 2006 courtesy of <a href="http://www.lujorecords.com" target="new">Lujo Records</a>.</p>

<p>The Gena Rowlands Band and ASM met three years ago during the creation of the original production of <i>The Nitrate Hymnal</i> by <b>Bob Massey</b> (Gena Rowlands Band, ex-<b>Telegraph Melts</b>) and <b>David Wilson</b> (True/False Film Festival).  The opera was inspired by 50 years of actual home movies given to Bob by his grandfather, and told a fictional story of a couple who obsessively filmed their lives. Staged in a Masonic temple, lit by three giant projection screens, and bringing together players from D.C.'s underground rock scene (ex- <b>Circus Lupus</b>, <b>Crownhate Ruin</b>, <b>Frodus</b>, <b>Mary Timony Band</b>) and New York's avant-classical scene, <i>The Nitrate Hymnal</i> sold out its four-night run and won lavish press attention.</p>

<p>Says <b>The Washington Post</b> about music from the original production:</p>
<blockquote>"Despite Massey's pedigree as a post-punk guitarist, much of 'Hymnal' hearkens back to 17th-century opera, with lithe, chantlike vocal lines written as nearly continuous recitative, and a chamber orchestra (acoustic strings, electric guitars, keyboards and drums) playing a gently supportive role.  But if the form of "Hymnal" hasn't reinvented the operatic wheel, its sound world feels fresh.  That's not to say Massey doesn't raid a few genres &ndash; post-punk rubs shoulders with post-Sondheim; progressive jazz melds with fusion; and brief visits are paid by Shostakovich, Piazzolla and Glenn Branca &ndash; but the musical stew is very much his own.  There's less guitar-driven music than you might expect from an indie-rock composer.  But the canny orchestration... uses the guitars for color, to growl threateningly under the strings or simply add a little grit."</blockquote>

<h2 class="singleline recording">The Recording</h2>

<p>For the recording, the through-composed score was cut into songs and reorchestrated by ASM and Gena Rowlands Band, then recorded in three days powered by passion and caffeine.  Mixed at Brown Rice by <b>Warn Defever</b> of <b>His Name is Alive</b>, mastered at <b>Silver Sonya</b> by <b>TJ Lipple</b> of <b>Aloha</b> and <a href="http://www.lujorecords.com/store.php" target="new">available now</a> from Lujo Records.</p>
